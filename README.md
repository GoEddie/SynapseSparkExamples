# SynapseSparkExamples

This is a set of examples of how to convert from T-SQL to Spark SQL and then to .NET for Apache Spark (C#). The repo is a deployable repo to Azure Synapse Analytics (fork it and hook it up to your workspace!)

The code depends on a serverless database called "chicago-sql" being manually created and the two setup scripts being run.

There is an additional blog post that goes along with each example and that is available:
